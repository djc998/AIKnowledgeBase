# AIKnowledgeBase

This is a ChatGPT based AI Knowledgebase Chat Bot that allows a user using the ChatGPT API to create a searchable Knowledgebase based on data 
that the company has this can be anything from PDF's, Text Files, HTML that ChatGPT will use in order to return suggested results. 

## Background

At my current company we were looking for ways to easily use ChatGPT in providing support to our customers. Our Professional Services has a large database
of Wiki's, technical documents along with case resolution data for our large inventory of products. The goal of this project was to develop an 
assistant that can help our support quickly triage issues raised by our customers. In this Bot we created we explored a scalable solution for adding our
existing information to ChatGPT so that we can return target results to help our employees.
